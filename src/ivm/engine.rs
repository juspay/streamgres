//! The seam between an engine and the runtime that feeds it: the engine
//! never reads storage itself. Where it needs rows it does not hold (a
//! registration's initial result set, a join edge's newly referenced
//! value, a drained window's refill) it records a [`Fetch`] request and
//! carries on; the runtime runs the read, brings its result up to the
//! point the engine has reached, and lands the rest through
//! [`Engine::land`]. Positions never enter the engine: what lands is
//! current by construction. [`Engine`] is what the two engines
//! (single-table and join tree) expose to that runtime. An engine knows
//! subscriptions and nothing of the clients behind them: every delta it
//! emits names the subscriptions it applies to ([`super::Delta`]), and
//! whose they are is the transport's business.

//! ORDER BY / LIMIT maintenance: the per-subscription window state and
//! the engine hooks that keep it — and its **boundary condition** in the
//! routing index — in lockstep with the held rows.
//!
//! A query with a finite `LIMIT L` is maintained as a **doubled buffer**:
//! storage queries are issued with `2·L`, and the subscription keeps a
//! [`Window`] — its held rows' order values, best → worst, plus the
//! **frontier**: the worst order value known to be *covered* from
//! storage, meaning every matching row strictly better than it is held.
//! Storage reads set the frontier (the worst value fetched when a read
//! returned as many rows as it asked for; absent when it returned fewer,
//! since storage is then exhausted and every matching row is held), and
//! evictions pull it in (an evicted row is back in storage unheld, so the
//! covered prefix ends at its value). Three behaviors derive from it:
//!
//! - **admission boundary**: the strict condition "better than the
//!   frontier" (`<` for ASC, `>` for DESC), whether or not the buffer is
//!   full; absent while storage is exhausted. It is *pushed into the
//!   table's routing index* ([`SingleTableIVM::sync_boundary`]) whenever
//!   it changes, so `matched()` itself drops candidates the boundary
//!   rejects — a write beyond the frontier never even reaches the engine,
//!   and rows are never admitted unboundedly. The boundary gates
//!   **admission only**: a row the subscription already holds is exempt
//!   (it keeps its slot when its value worsens, until a better arrival
//!   evicts it).
//! - **eviction** ([`SingleTableIVM::evict_overflow`]): rows past
//!   capacity are untagged worst-first, each emitting its `Delete` and
//!   becoming the frontier.
//! - **refill** ([`SingleTableIVM::refill`]): when a removal drains the
//!   buffer to `L`, one storage read is asked for from the frontier
//!   *inclusive* (`>=` for ASC, `<=` for DESC), sized for the missing rows
//!   plus the held rows the threshold returns again (they dedup on
//!   upsert), back up to capacity; when it lands the frontier moves to
//!   the worst value fetched. When the order is unique (it ends in the
//!   row key) and the frontier is a read's worst row, the read starts
//!   strictly past it: that row was read and decided; an evicted row at
//!   the frontier is read again. Anchoring both the boundary and the
//!   refill at the frontier rather than at the worst *held* row is what
//!   keeps the top-`L` exact: a row admitted while the buffer had room
//!   can never push the refill threshold past storage rows that were
//!   never fetched, and rows tying the frontier stay reachable.
//!
//! `ORDER BY` may name several columns, compared in turn. The order value
//! of a row is then a tuple, the frontier one too, and the boundary and
//! refill threshold become the lexicographic comparison spelled out as a
//! predicate: for `ORDER BY a ASC, b ASC` and frontier `(fa, fb)` the
//! admission boundary is `a < fa OR (a = fa AND b < fb)`, one branch per
//! column with the earlier columns tied, each branch strict in its own
//! direction; the refill threshold is the same shape with the operators
//! reversed and the last column inclusive. A frontier with a `NULL` or
//! `NaN` in any column is unenforceable, as for one column.
//!
//! **What the client sees.** The buffer is the engine's; the client is sent
//! exactly the best `L` rows. After every step that touched a windowed
//! subscription its raw operations are narrowed
//! ([`SingleTableIVM::gate_window`]) to the difference between the previous
//! and the current best-`L` prefix: a row entering the prefix is an `Add`
//! (whether it arrived from storage or a write, or moved up from the
//! buffer), a row leaving it a `Delete` (whether it left the buffer or was
//! pushed down into it), a shown row rewritten in place its own operations
//! (the `Delete` + `Add` pair the join layer diffs, one `Add` at the
//! client); buffer rows below the prefix produce nothing. A twin registration and
//! [`SingleTableIVM::rows_for`] see the same prefix.
//!
//! **A page under a gate.** In the join layer a windowed part may drive an
//! inner edge, and the rows that edge rejects (no sub row matches them)
//! must not take a place in the page: the page is the best `L` rows *the
//! gate lets through*, as the client's `Take` above its `Exists` computes it.
//! Such a part registers its window as a **page**
//! ([`SingleTableIVM::register_page`]), and the window then tells held
//! rows apart: a **candidate** is a held row the gate has not decided
//! yet, an **admitted** row one the gate let through, and what the layer
//! above sees (the prefix the operations are narrowed to) is the
//! candidates and the admitted rows together, so every candidate's sub
//! rows are asked for as soon as it is held. A client is sent the first
//! `L` admitted rows only ([`Window::client_prefix`]); the layer keeps
//! that view and ships its changes. The page reaches in **rounds**: a
//! round decides a batch of candidates (the layer tells the window which
//! ones its gate closed on, [`SingleTableIVM::finish_round`], once the
//! reads that could open them have landed), and when fewer than `L` rows
//! are admitted after that the next batch follows — twice the size of the
//! last, no larger than the engine's row limit, the first
//! `max(10·L, 100)` rows. A page **read whole** holds every row of its
//! filter from its one read, takes its batches from the rows it holds and
//! keeps the rows the gate rejected, held apart, so that a write opening
//! one's gate finds it in memory; a page **read in batches** reads each
//! batch from its frontier, and drops the rejected rows outright (they
//! are behind the frontier, never read again). The page keeps `2·L`
//! admitted rows with their sub rows; admitted rows past those are
//! demoted (back to waiting in memory, or evicted behind the frontier).
//! After [`PAGE_ROUNDS`] rounds without filling, the page is **capped**:
//! it reaches no further (its page then holds fewer than `L` rows;
//! `window_capped` counts it, and the join layer names the subscriptions)
//! until one of its admitted rows leaves, which starts the rounds over.
//!
//! A storage read lands some time after it is asked for, and writes route
//! in between. While one is out the window publishes **no boundary** (so
//! no write the read will not return is turned away; arrivals are
//! admitted and, past capacity, evicted, each eviction pulling the
//! frontier in as usual) and asks for no further refill; a read that
//! covers the whole filter (a registration's snapshot, a refill) also
//! clears the frontier when asked for, since what storage holds beyond
//! the held rows is unknown until it lands. Landing then re-derives the
//! frontier: a full result covers up to its worst value, pulled in by any
//! eviction that happened meanwhile; a short result leaves it where the
//! evictions put it (absent if there were none, meaning storage is
//! exhausted). A **lookup** ([`SingleTableIVM::lookup`]) is the exception:
//! it asks for the rows of one join value, lands only those better than
//! the frontier and leaves the frontier alone.
//!
//! Rows are ordered with [`order_cmp`], a total order extending
//! [`crate::model::Value::compare`]: `NaN` sorts above every other
//! numeric and `Null` above everything (Postgres's convention that both
//! are "largest"), and remaining incomparable pairs fall back to a fixed
//! variant rank. A `Null`/`NaN` **frontier** is unenforceable as a
//! predicate (comparisons touching them are always false), so the window
//! then publishes no boundary rather than reject everything — admission
//! falls back to accept-then-evict, and refills run unthresholded, sized
//! to capacity (re-fetched held rows dedup harmlessly). Ties are broken
//! arbitrarily, like SQL. A `LIMIT 0` subscription publishes an
//! always-false boundary (`IN ()`), so it stays permanently empty.

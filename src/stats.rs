//! What the server measures about itself: how long each stage of the
//! pipeline takes for a committed transaction, from the feed thread
//! decoding it to the last frame of the poke it produced being written;
//! the query path's stages, so a hydration's time splits into the
//! application server's, PostgreSQL's and the engine's own; the counters
//! that say how much work went through; and the gauges that say what the
//! process holds. Every duration and count is recorded into lock-free
//! atomics by the thread doing the work (one `fetch_add` a sample); the
//! reading, as `/stats` JSON, `/metrics` in Prometheus exposition format,
//! or the periodic summary line, is done elsewhere, from the atomics.
//!
//! A histogram has four buckets per power of two, so a percentile is
//! exact to within a fifth of its value, and it costs one atomic add per
//! sample. `docs/observability.md` is the catalogue.

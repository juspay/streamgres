//! The engine side wired over PostgreSQL: a feed thread that holds the
//! replication connection, decodes the `pgoutput` events into rows and
//! hands the engine one transaction per commit (reopening the slot when
//! the connection drops), and, on the caller's engine thread, the storage
//! (its reads on the pool) and the [`Service`]. Whoever serves clients
//! talks to this side over the service's channels, commands in and events
//! out, and never touches a database connection.
//!
//! The order at start is what makes the first snapshot and the feed
//! agree: the slot is made to exist, then the storage mints its first
//! snapshot, then the feed opens with the slot moved up to that
//! snapshot's point, so it streams exactly what the snapshot does not
//! hold. Each process streams from a slot of its own, named
//! [`SLOT_PREFIX`] and a fresh UUID: a restart needs nothing of the
//! slot before it (the slot is moved up to the first snapshot anyway).
//! At startup it can drop this server's inactive slots once they have
//! exceeded an explicitly configured age; the PostgreSQL 17
//! `inactive_since` timestamp makes that cleanup safe across restarts.
//! Schema changes reach the feed as the messages of the schema-change
//! event trigger ([`super::ddl`]); the server refuses to serve
//! without that trigger ([`require_ddl_trigger`]).
//!
//! A consumer that must read some rows for itself (an application's
//! mutation-id table, say) names those tables in [`Settings::watched`].
//! Their writes travel inside the transaction that carried them and reach
//! the consumer in its [`Event::Committed`], so a mutation's rows and its
//! id are one poke and no later transaction's id rides out early.

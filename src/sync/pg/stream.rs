//! The change feed: a logical replication connection on a permanent slot,
//! streaming the `pgoutput` plugin's messages, turned into [`WriteQuery`]s
//! positioned at the **end of their transaction's commit record**. A
//! snapshot taken at a consistent point `X` holds exactly the writes
//! positioned at or below `X`, so that is the position every read is
//! compared against.
//!
//! The transport is `pgwire-replication` (startup, authentication,
//! `START_REPLICATION`, standby feedback; it decodes the transaction
//! boundaries) and the row messages are decoded by the `pgoutput` crate;
//! this module only maps decoded tuples onto the catalog's tables and
//! types.
//!
//! # Where the feed is
//!
//! The feed writes nothing to the database, so it follows a primary, a
//! logical replica and a physical standby alike. Its position comes from
//! what the server sends anyway. A **commit** carries the end of its
//! record, and decoding emits whole transactions in commit order, so
//! every transaction committed before it has been delivered. A
//! **keepalive** carries the location the server has decoded up to: the
//! server sends one whenever it has gone through log that held nothing
//! for this slot (another database's writes, a vacuum, a checkpoint, the
//! record a snapshot's slot is built from) and is about to wait for more,
//! as long as that location is past what the feed has confirmed; every
//! transaction that committed at or below it was sent before it on the
//! same connection. Both are confirmed back to the slot, so the server
//! keeps no log for a feed that is only idle. While the log stands still
//! the position does too, and nothing is owed: a snapshot cannot be
//! ahead of a log that has not moved.
//!
//! # A feed that has gone silent
//!
//! A connection can die without either end being told (a network that
//! drops its state, a machine that slept): nothing arrives, nothing
//! fails, and a server that went on serving would be serving what it
//! last knew. Silence alone does not say so: an idle database is silent,
//! and so is a server working through a long stretch of log that holds
//! nothing for this slot. What does say so is the slot: while this
//! connection lives, PostgreSQL shows the slot as held by its walsender,
//! and when the walsender has given up on a peer it no longer hears
//! (`wal_sender_timeout`), the slot is free. So once nothing has been
//! heard for [`SILENCE`] the server is asked, on a fresh ordinary
//! connection, whether the slot is still held (a read), and asked again
//! every half of that while the silence lasts. A slot nobody holds means
//! this connection is dead: it is given up and the caller reopens the
//! slot, which resumes after the last position the server had confirmed.
//! A server that cannot be asked proves nothing, and the feed waits.

//! The storage boundary: where rows the engine does not yet hold are read
//! from. Every read is asynchronous and reports, with its rows, the WAL
//! location its snapshot reflects every commit up to. A source is told how
//! far the write stream has been delivered ([`Storage::advance`]) and may
//! only answer reads from snapshots at or below that point, so a read is
//! never ahead of what the engine has applied; it also says the lowest
//! location a read may be positioned at from now on ([`Storage::floor`]),
//! which is how far back the runtime keeps delivered writes to bring a
//! read up. The in-process [`MemoryStorage`] is always at the stream
//! position (it holds the current rows, no bring-up needed); a source that
//! mints snapshots ahead of time (see `pg`) flips to a newer snapshot only
//! once the stream has passed it.

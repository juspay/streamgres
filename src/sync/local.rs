//! The synchronous driver: for storage that answers at once (the
//! in-process [`super::MemoryStorage`]), every read the runtime hands out
//! is run inline and landed before the call returns, so registration and
//! routing keep the plain call-and-return shape of the engine itself.
//! This is the driver the test suites, the demo and the benchmark use.

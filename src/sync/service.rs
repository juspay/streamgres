//! The asynchronous driver: one task owns the runtime, takes commands
//! (subscribe, unsubscribe) from a channel and committed transactions
//! from the feed's, hands every delta to an event channel, and runs the
//! storage reads the runtime asks for. Every read, a registration's
//! snapshot as much as a join fetch or a window refill, runs as its own
//! task while the loop keeps routing; the loop never waits on storage, and
//! each result is brought up to the engine's position when it lands. The
//! runtime is touched only between awaits. Single-threaded by design: run
//! it on a [`tokio::task::LocalSet`].
//!
//! Besides the deltas, the events tell a consumer what it needs to batch
//! and to acknowledge without touching the runtime: which subscription a
//! registration became, when a subscription's first rows have all
//! arrived, when a read landed, and where the stream is after each
//! transaction, with the writes on the tables the consumer watches for
//! itself. Everything a consumer learns arrives on that one stream, so a
//! subscription is always named before anything about it is: no consumer
//! ever meets a [`SubId`] it has not been told about. The consumer may be
//! several ([`Service::with_sinks`]): a registration says which sink asked
//! for it, the service remembers the sink of every subscription, and what
//! concerns a subscription (its deltas, its refusal, its completion) goes
//! to that sink alone, each delta cut down to the subscriptions the sink
//! owns; what concerns everyone (a commit) goes to every sink. The engine
//! under the service never learns of clients or sinks: it names
//! subscriptions, and this is where a subscription finds its way home.

//! Which side of every inner edge drives it, decided before a query
//! registers, and the cache that makes deciding the exception.
//!
//! A node nothing drives is read **whole**: every row it matches sits in
//! memory. A driven node holds only the rows matching its driver's
//! values, and a node with a page (`LIMIT`) holds its window. The planner
//! counts every node it may have to decide, all in one batch and no
//! further than the configured limit plus one, twice: **alone** — its own
//! filter with its `EXISTS` leaves taken as true, what it holds when it
//! drives — and **narrowed** — the join result at the node, its `EXISTS`
//! leaves answered by its subs all the way down, what it holds when its
//! subs drive it (a node without inner subs is the same either way and is
//! counted once). The tree is then sized from the leaves up and decided
//! from the root down by one rule: **a node's subs drive it when they cut
//! it down by more than they cost**. Every node is given the rows its
//! subtree holds at best, its *hold*: read whole, its alone count; driven
//! by its subs, its narrowed count plus the hold of every sub that drives
//! it — the smaller of the two is its plan and its hold. Only a bounded
//! sub (one with a hold) can drive. A sub whose `EXISTS` sits under an
//! `OR` must drive for the narrowing to mean anything (the filter is only
//! cut down once every branch is), so with one of those unbounded the
//! node is read whole; a sub the filter requires (an `AND` conjunct, or
//! an edge no leaf names) drives when it costs no more than what the node
//! keeps with the drivers before it, smallest first, or when nothing else
//! drives; and under a page every bounded sub drives, so the window is
//! restricted exactly and gates nothing. A tie goes to the preferred
//! side, except that a page never wins one. A node driven from above — a
//! LEFT child, the parent of a RIGHT child, the driven side of an inner
//! edge — is narrowed already and drives every inner sub below it without
//! a comparison: its rows are the few its driver's values reach, whatever
//! the table holds, so nothing below it is counted. A node with no
//! bounded plan refuses the query, naming the tables, unless it has a
//! page: the page drives, reading its window and keeping it to the rows
//! its subs admit (see the `window` module). The root never changes: the
//! decision is a `driver` per edge ([`Join::driver`]), so part paths,
//! hidden parts and `EXISTS` leaves all stay where the translation put
//! them, and an inner edge at any depth is planned the same way as one at
//! the root. Two `EXISTS` on one to-one relationship were made one node
//! before any of this (`ast::merge_exists`), so they are counted and
//! compared as one.
//!
//! So the canvases a reader may see — `createdBy = me OR EXISTS
//! participants(userId = me OR EXISTS group(EXISTS member = me) OR EXISTS
//! channel(EXISTS member = me))`, twenty thousand canvases, a page of
//! twenty — are read from the leaves: the reader's few memberships drive
//! their groups and channels, those and the reader's own participations
//! drive the few hundred participations, and those drive the page,
//! `canvases WHERE createdBy = me OR id IN (…) ORDER BY … LIMIT 20`, one
//! read; a page counted alone against a participants table counted whole
//! would have walked the table. A page of one canvas by id still drives
//! everything from the row outwards: alone it is one row, and no sub
//! costs less than that.
//!
//! **A main with a page** is counted like any other node, on its own
//! filter with its cursor and its `LIMIT` ignored, so a new cursor is a
//! new plan and a page turn costs its counts on the root. Driven by its
//! subs it holds its window at most, so its narrowed count is taken no
//! higher than its `LIMIT`, and a page whose counts are both over the
//! limit is still served: driven by its bounded subs, else driving them
//! all, reading its window in batches and keeping it to the rows they
//! admit.
//!
//! **How a page that drives is read** is the planner's last word
//! ([`MultiTableReadQuery::page`]): a page whose alone count is within
//! the whole-page limit ([`Policy::whole`]) is read **whole** — every row
//! of its filter in one read, the `LIMIT` applied in memory, the rows its
//! edge rejects kept, so the edge's restriction stays exact — and any
//! other page in **batches** that double from one round to the next, the
//! rows its edge rejects dropped and the driven side routing on its own
//! filter (see the `multi` module).
//!
//! The planner does no I/O: it hands out the counts it wants and takes
//! the answers back, so the caller runs them wherever it can and the
//! decision stays a pure function that tests drive with numbers. [`plan`]
//! is that caller for the server, and it plans a query once per **name**
//! rather than once per set of arguments: the plan (every edge's driver,
//! every page's read) is remembered by the query's name for
//! `XYNE_SYNC_PLAN_QUERY_TTL_MS` (a day) and laid onto every later tree
//! of that name, whoever asks and with whatever arguments — ids, lists,
//! page sizes, cursors — so the counts run a few dozen times a day, not
//! once per user, channel or cursor. A plan is about the join tree, not
//! the filters, so it lays onto any tree of the same join skeleton; a name
//! whose arguments add or drop a join (an optional `whereExists`) is
//! planned once per skeleton. So a plan is made on the numbers of the
//! first arguments that ask, and a later argument the plan does not suit
//! is bounded by the read limit like any read. Only a plan that was made
//! is remembered by name; a refusal is remembered for its own tree only
//! (keyed as translated, the identity the engine's twin sharing uses, for
//! `XYNE_SYNC_PLAN_TTL_MS`), so one argument's refusal never spreads to
//! every other.

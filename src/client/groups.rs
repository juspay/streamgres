//! Every client group's view, and the threads that keep them. A group
//! thread owns no engine, no storage and no database connection: it sends
//! the engine side subscribe and unsubscribe commands and reads back that
//! side's events (deltas, hydrated subscriptions, landings, commits),
//! turning both into the pokes a Zero client expects. Connections hand it
//! requests over a channel (connect, disconnect, planned queries, pulls)
//! and receive finished frames.
//!
//! # Threads, batches, bytes
//!
//! There are `XYNE_SYNC_GROUP_THREADS` of these threads, each owning the
//! groups whose id hashes to it; the engine side knows which thread
//! registered each subscription and sends it that subscription's share of
//! every delta, so a thread hears only of its own groups. A thread
//! wakes, takes everything the connections and the engine side have sent
//! since, applies all of it, and only then pokes each group that has
//! something to hear, once: idle, that is one poke per transaction; under
//! load one poke carries every transaction that arrived meanwhile, which
//! is what keeps the frame count per connection bounded as the write rate
//! climbs. Every row image is serialized to its `rowsPatch` bytes once,
//! the first time any group is sent it, and the bytes stay on the image
//! for every group's frame that carries it, in this flush or a later one;
//! a group's frame is a prefix, those fragments, and a suffix, so a poke
//! costs the bookkeeping and a copy, never a JSON tree per group.
//!
//! # A client group's view
//!
//! Zero's client keeps one row store per client group, shared by its
//! queries, and learns of changes as pokes: a versioned batch of row puts
//! and dels, query-state patches and mutation ids. This module keeps, per
//! group, the queries each of its clients desires (by hash), the
//! subscription behind each query, and for every row shipped the
//! subscription parts holding it, so a row is `del`ed only when its last
//! holder lets go. A poke goes out per
//! committed transaction (so a mutation's rows and its `lastMutationID`
//! travel together), per landed read, and per query change, advancing the
//! group's version; the version is the cookie the client hands back when
//! it reconnects.
//!
//! # A client that comes back, or comes late
//!
//! What a client is owed is everything after its cookie, and a group
//! answers that in one of four ways ([`Groups::connect`]):
//!
//! - **The cookie is the group's version.** Nothing is owed. This is the
//!   usual reconnect, because a group with no connection open stands
//!   still: its deltas are still accounted against its row ledger as they
//!   arrive, but they wait as one coalesced list of row operations and no
//!   poke is built, so the version stays where the last client left it and
//!   the first poke after it returns carries all it missed.
//! - **No cookie, and the group is under way** (a tab opened before the
//!   store it shares held a cookie). The newcomer is sent the group's
//!   whole state from the ledger, as one poke from nothing to the group's
//!   version; the other connections of the group are not disturbed.
//! - **An older cookie the group's log still reaches** (a tab that was
//!   away while another kept the group moving). The group keeps its most
//!   recent pokes, as the frames it already built, up to
//!   `XYNE_SYNC_GROUP_LOG_BYTES`: every poke sent is kept and the oldest
//!   dropped until the rest fit, whether or not anyone was really
//!   listening (a socket that died unnoticed is sent to, and logged for,
//!   until the server learns of it). The returning connection is sent the
//!   ones after its cookie, as they were — but for the mutation ids: each
//!   replayed poke closes with a part carrying the group's mutation ids
//!   as they are *now*, so the first poke the client processes already
//!   confirms every mutation the application has processed since the
//!   poke was built. A logged poke tells the ids of its time; a client
//!   rebases its still-pending mutations against every poke that does not
//!   confirm them, and one of those, replayed stale, can make a mutator
//!   fail on a row the poke has since removed and drop the connection —
//!   on every reconnect, since the replay is the same. The client merges
//!   a poke's parts in order and refuses an id that goes backwards, so
//!   every replayed poke gets the same current ids, in its last part.
//! - **Anything else** (a cookie older than the log, or from a server
//!   that is gone): the client is told to start over, and syncs afresh.
//!
//! The application's mutation ids arrive as writes to its clients table,
//! which the engine side carries inside the transaction's own
//! [`Event::Committed`], so a mutation's rows and its id go out in the
//! same poke and no later transaction's id rides out early. At every
//! connect they are also read from the table itself, merged into what the
//! group knows, and sent with the connection's first poke: the state
//! poke, the replayed pokes, or a poke of their own at the next flush.
//!
//! The result of a mutation the application server refused (an
//! application error; a mutation that succeeds leaves none) is recorded in
//! its results table in the same transaction as the mutation's id, and
//! reaches the group the same way: as a `mutationsPatch` entry in the same
//! poke as the id, as zero-cache sends it. The client applies a poke whole
//! and settles its mutations from the results before it counts the id,
//! so the mutation is rejected with the application's error rather than
//! taken for a success. Once the client acknowledges its results the
//! application server deletes them, and the deletions go out the same way.
//! At every connect the results still waiting are read with the ids and
//! sent with them.
